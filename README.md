## Introduction:

shrkbot is a helpful bot for moderation and utility use. 

## Setup:

### Setup to run the bot yourself:

First, you will need to [create an application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me), as you will need the token of it to start the bot. You will also need a MySQL database, which is what the bot uses for persistence.

The bot expects a file of this format called `.login` in the same directory as `shrkbot.rb`.
```
---
:token: <discord token of your application>
:client_id: <client_id of your app>
:server_name: <server the database is on (can be localhost)>
:username: <username for the database>
:server_password: <password for the server the database is on (can be blank if server has no PW / localhost)>
:db_name: <name of the database you want to use (needs to be MySQL)>
:db_password: <password for the database>

```

### Setup for servers:

Simply [invite to server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=346043915142561793&scope=bot&permissions=8) and it will set itself up. Anything it can’t do automatically it will DM the server owner about. To recognize staff members, the bot uses a role called **BotCommand**, which will be automatically created when the bot joins your server. Simply assign it to your staff members so the bot knows who should have access to more administrative commands.

The bot’s default prefix is `.`, which means you can call commands with `.<command>`. However, the prefix can be set on a per server basis using the `setPrefix <prefix>` command. The only two commands that statically use the `.` prefix are `.prefix` (which returns the prefix currently set for this server) and `.resetPrefix` (which resets the prefix to `.`). The latter can be used in case the prefix gets set to something the bot can’t react to (e.g. an emoji).

All commands are case-insensitive, but will be written in camelCase in the documentation so they’re easier to read.

Required parameters will be written in `<>`, optional ones in `[]`.

**IMPORTANT**: In its current state, shrkbot has some issues when joining a server without restarting. Please DM me (TrueBlackShark#6987) on Discord, if you'd like to use shrkbot!
